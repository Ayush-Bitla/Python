## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

### **Day 1**
#### 1. `hello.py`
- A simple introductory script to print "Hello, World!" using Python.
- Demonstrates the basics of variable assignment and the `print()` function.

#### 2. `data_types.py`
- Explores Python data types, including:
  - **Strings**: Assignment, concatenation, multiline strings, escaping characters, and string methods.
  - **Numbers**: Integer, float, complex types, and operations like rounding, casting, and absolute value.
  - **Booleans**: Boolean values and type-checking.
- Includes a practical example of formatting a menu with string manipulation.

#### 3. `meaning.py`
- Implements a ternary operator to evaluate a condition and provide output.
- A minimalistic script to reinforce conditional statements.

#### 4. `rps.py` (Rock-Paper-Scissors Game)
- A Python implementation of the classic "Rock-Paper-Scissors" game:
  - Utilizes `random` and `enum` modules for computer choice and better code readability.
  - Includes input validation and user interaction.
  - Simple logic for determining the winner.

#### 5. `welcome.py`
- A script to display a simple welcome message using formatted strings.
- Introduces header/footer design and code reusability.
