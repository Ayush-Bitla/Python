## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

### **Day 1**
#### 1. [`hello.py`](https://github.com/Ayush-Bitla/Python/blob/main/Day1/hello.py)
- A simple introductory script to print "Hello, World!" using Python.
- Demonstrates the basics of variable assignment and the `print()` function.

#### 2. [`data_types.py`](https://github.com/Ayush-Bitla/Python/blob/main/Day1/data_types.py)
- Explores Python data types, including:
  - **Strings**: Assignment, concatenation, multiline strings, escaping characters, and string methods.
  - **Numbers**: Integer, float, complex types, and operations like rounding, casting, and absolute value.
  - **Booleans**: Boolean values and type-checking.
- Includes a practical example of formatting a menu with string manipulation.

#### 3. [`meaning.py`](https://github.com/Ayush-Bitla/Python/blob/main/Day1/meaning.py)
- Implements a ternary operator to evaluate a condition and provide output.
- A minimalistic script to reinforce conditional statements.

#### 4. [`rps.py`](https://github.com/Ayush-Bitla/Python/blob/main/Day1/rps.py) (Rock-Paper-Scissors Game)
- A Python implementation of the classic "Rock-Paper-Scissors" game:
  - Utilizes `random` and `enum` modules for computer choice and better code readability.
  - Includes input validation and user interaction.
  - Simple logic for determining the winner.

#### 5. [`welcome.py`](https://github.com/Ayush-Bitla/Python/blob/main/Day1/welcome.py)
- A script to display a simple welcome message using formatted strings.
- Introduces header/footer design and code reusability.

### **Day 2**
#### 1. [`dictionaries.py`](https://github.com/Ayush-Bitla/Python/blob/main/Day2/dictionaries.py)
- Explores Python dictionaries and their key-value operations:
  - **Creating Dictionaries**: Using curly braces and the `dict()` constructor.
  - **Accessing and Modifying Data**: Using keys, `.get()`, and `.update()`.
  - **Nested Dictionaries**: Storing complex data structures.

#### 2. [`sets.py`](https://github.com/Ayush-Bitla/Python/blob/main/Day2/sets.py)
- Introduces Python sets and their unique characteristics:
  - **Creating Sets**: Using curly braces or the `set()` constructor.
  - **Set Operations**: Union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.
  - **Updating Sets**: Using `.add()` and `.update()` methods.

#### 3. [`lists.py`](https://github.com/Ayush-Bitla/Python/blob/main/Day2/lists.py)
- Delves into Python lists and their operations:
  - **Adding Elements**: Using `.append()` and `.extend()`.
  - **Slicing and Sorting**: Utilizing slicing to modify lists and `.sort()` to arrange elements.
  - **Multi-type Lists**: Handling lists with mixed data types.

#### 4. [`tuples.py`](https://github.com/Ayush-Bitla/Python/blob/main/Day2/tuples.py)
- Explains tuples and their immutability:
  - **Creating Tuples**: Using parentheses or the `tuple()` constructor.
  - **Unpacking Tuples**: Using unpacking techniques for assigning values.
